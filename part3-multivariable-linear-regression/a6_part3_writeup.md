# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The r squared coefficient for my modle is 0.86, so the model data had positive corrilation.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
The model is not accurate because as a car is used less and kept in good contition, it is worth more, not less. A car would be worh less he more you use it and the older it gets(Most of the time), meaning that ther are a few small outliers.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
The model predicts that a 10 year old car wirh 89000 miles is worth about $8694,47.The model predicts that a 20 year old car with 150000 miles is worth about $1744.14.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
I think that some of the predicted values are turning up negative because the price goes down, age and mile go up, so on a graph it would look like the price goes into the negative values, messing up the predictions.
