# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

The first group(Purple) would be called the low spenders as they do not make much and do not spend as mush at a store. The second group(Blue) would be called the high spenders as they also do not make very much money but spend more than the low spenders. The third group(Green) would be called the barginers as the make a decent amount of money and do not spend a lot in stores but also do not cheap out when it comes to food. The fourth group(Orange) are the cheapskates as they mak a lot of money but choose not to spend a lot at stores. The last group(Red) would be called the overspender as they make a lot of money and only spend it on expensive goods when shopping.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

A customer with a medium income and low spending habits would be part of the barginers(Green).

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

I chose to appeal to the barginers, and the marketing team would make the prices of food and house essentials a bit cheaper but put them closer to the registers so that they have to go through the entire store before reaching the cheap items to lure them in and spend at least a reasonable amount of money.
