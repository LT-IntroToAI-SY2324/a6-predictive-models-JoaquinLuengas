# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

The r squared value is 0.6257932855322312, meaning that the linear regression model has positive correlation.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person is who is 43 years old?

The predicted systolic blood pressure for a person that is 43 years old is about 137.46.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that the model's predictions are accurate for an average of a group of people because not everyone of the same age would have the same blood pressure and blood pressure changes differently for people when aging. A few things that could improve the model could be to add an API of a blood pressure list on a medical website or to use more recent data from people of different ages with multiple groups of people of the same age.
