# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

The allowing of predicting the accuracy of a given y value or blood pressure to the actual y value as it gives a bit of freedom to the user on how close their listed blood pressure is to the actual data based on the age they list.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R Squared value of 0.6906234761887463 tells us that the model has positive corrilation.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

The model is accurate because it is true that health complications such as hih blood pressure start becoming more of a problem as you age. According to a chart from the American Heart Association, the predictions are almost 100% accurate to the actual data on the blood pressure model and the chart.Before adulthood, the blood pressure of those individuals is normal but after about 25, the risk for problems regarding blood pressure starts to increase with the worst being past age 45 with blood pressures of higher than 180.
